    "\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook, you'll build a robust, multi-agent AI workflow for automating sales email generation and delivery. You'll explore how to orchestrate multiple LLM-powered agents, enforce input guardrails to prevent mistakes (like leaking personal names), and use structured outputs for reliable downstream processing.  \n",
    "By the end, you'll have a system that can generate, select, and send professional sales emails—safely and efficiently—using the latest agentic AI techniques.\n"

    "The `@input_guardrail` decorator in the **OpenAI Agent SDK** plays a critical role in ensuring that the agent's **inputs are safe, clean, or policy-compliant before execution**. Here's a breakdown of **why we need it** and **how it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why We Need `@input_guardrail`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of agentic workflows, agents interact with user inputs or data that may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsafe (e.g., containing personal info like names or emails)\n",
    "* Against policy (e.g., prompts triggering offensive language)\n",
    "* Incorrectly formatted (e.g., malformed JSON, missing keys)\n",
    "* Unwanted for a specific agent behavior (e.g., commands instead of questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The guardrail acts like a **pre-check filter or gatekeeper**, preventing an agent from executing if the input doesn't meet certain requirements or safety standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step through what happens in your example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@input_guardrail  # <--- Decorator registers the function as an input validation step\n",
    "async def guardrail_against_name(ctx, agent, message):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Registration**: The `@input_guardrail` decorator tells the Agent SDK that this function is an *input guardrail*. It will be **called before** the actual agent is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    result = await Runner.run(guardrail_agent, message, context=ctx.context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Execution**: It runs another *guardrail agent* (`guardrail_agent`) to analyze the input `message`. This could be a specialized model that looks for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Named Entities (e.g., personal names)\n",
    "  * Sensitive topics\n",
    "  * Profanity or abuse\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    is_name_in_message = result.final_output.is_name_in_message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpretation**: From the result, it checks if a personal name was found in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return GuardrailFunctionOutput(\n",
    "        output_info={\"found_name\": result.final_output},\n",
    "        tripwire_triggered=is_name_in_message\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tripwire**: If the name was found, `tripwire_triggered=True`. This tells the Agent SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > “⚠️ Don't let the main agent proceed — input violates the guardrail.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Conceptually\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like **middleware or a validator** in a web API:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Guardrail Step            | Equivalent                                 |\n",
    "| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| `@input_guardrail`        | Decorator that defines a validator         |\n",
    "| `Runner.run(...)`         | Executes a sub-agent or classifier         |\n",
    "| `tripwire_triggered=True` | Return 403 / prevent agent from continuing |\n",
    "| `output_info`             | Metadata or logs about what happened       |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Real Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use input guardrails for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blocking questions with PII (e.g., “What’s John's address?”)\n",
    "* Ensuring only specific formats (e.g., dates, JSON, SQL queries)\n",
